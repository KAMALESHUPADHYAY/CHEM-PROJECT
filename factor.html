                            Cloud cover is the amount of the sky obscured by clouds. Clouds are formed when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. Cloud cover can affect temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.

It is measured in units of millibars (mb) or inches of mercury (inHg). Changes in atmospheric pressure can influence weather patterns, such as the formation of storms and fronts.</b><br>

                            The death rate, also referred to as the mortality rate or fatality rate, is defined as the number of people per thousand who die in a particular area during a particular period of time, usually a year.

                            Temperature: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. In the context of weather, it refers to the warmth or coldness of the air. Temperature variations are caused by a combination of factors, including solar radiation, cloud cover, and atmospheric circulation.

                                Weather forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the field of public health, as it helps identify and mitigate potential health risks associated with various weather conditions. Weather data is used to monitor air quality, track the spread of vector-borne diseases, and issue warnings about extreme heat or cold events. Accurate weather forecasts can help protect public health by enabling preventive measures and early interventions. .
